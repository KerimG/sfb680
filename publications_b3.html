  class="publication01Abstract" style="display:none;">In mice, avirulent strains (e.g. types II and III) of the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii are restricted by the immunity-related GTPase (IRG) resistance system. Loading of IRG proteins onto the PVM is required for vacuolar rupture resulting in parasite clearance. In virulent strain (e.g. type I) infections polymorphic effector proteins ROP5 and ROP18 cooperate to phosphorylate and thereby inactivate mouse IRG proteins to preserve PVM integrity. In this study we confirmed the dense granule protein GRA7 as an additional component of the ROP5/ROP18 kinase complex and identified GRA7 association with the PVM by direct binding to ROP5. The absence of GRA7 results in reduced phosphorylation of Irga6 correlated with increased vacuolar IRG protein amounts and attenuated virulence. Earlier work identified additional IRG proteins as targets of T. gondii ROP18 kinase. We show that the only specific target of ROP18 among IRG proteins is in fact Irga6. Similarily, we demonstrate that GRA7 is strictly an Irga6-specific virulence effector. This identifies T. gondii GRA7 as a regulator for ROP18-specific inactivation of Irga6. The structural diversity of the IRG proteins implies that certain family members constitute additional specific targets for other yet unknown T. gondii virulence effectors.<div class="publication01HideAbstract"><a href="javascript:Publications.hideAbstract(16);">hide</a></div></div></div>

  class="publication01Abstract" style="display:none;">Virulence in the ubiquitous intracellular protozoon <em>Toxoplasma gondii</em> for its natural intermediate host, the mouse, appears paradoxical from an evolutionary standpoint because death of the mouse before encystment interrupts the parasite life cycle. Virulent <em>T. gondii</em> strains secrete kinases and pseudokinases that inactivate the immunity-related GTPases (IRG proteins) responsible for mouse resistance to avirulent strains. Such considerations stimulated a search for IRG alleles unknown in laboratory mice that might confer resistance to virulent strains of <em>T. gondii</em>. We report that the mouse IRG system shows extraordinary polymorphic complexity in the wild. We describe an IRG haplotype from a wild-derived mouse strain that confers resistance against virulent parasites by interference with the virulent kinase complex. In such hosts virulent strains can encyst, hinting at an explanation for the evolution of virulence polymorphism in <em>T. gondii</em>.<div class="publication01HideAbstract"><a href="javascript:Publications.hideAbstract(24);">hide</a></div></div></div><div id="publication28" class="publication01"><div

  class="publication01Abstract" style="display:none;">The IFN-inducible protein Irgm1 (LRG-47) belongs to the family of immunity-related GTPases that function in cell-autonomous resistance against intracellular pathogens in mice. Irgm1 deficiency is associated with a severe immunodeficiency syndrome. The protein has been variously interpreted as a direct effector molecule on bacterial phagosomes or on other organelles or as an inducer of autophagy. In this study, we re-examined one of these claims, namely that Irgm1 targets mycobacterial and listerial phagosomes. We found no colocalization of endogenous Irgm1, using two immunofluorescent staining techniques, either in fibroblasts or in macrophages. We demonstrated the predicted existence of two protein isoforms of Irgm1 derived from differential splicing and described immunological reagents for their detection. Both Irgm1 isoforms localize to the Golgi apparatus and weakly to mitochondria; however, only the long Irgm1 isoforms can be detected on endolysosomal membranes. Together with the previous observation that the general immunodeficiency phenotype of Irgm1(-/-) mice is reversed in Irgm1/Irgm3 double-deficient mice, our results argue against a direct effector function of Irgm1 at the bacterial phagosome. We discuss these findings in the context of evidence that Irgm1 functions as a negative regulator of other members of the immunity-related GTPase protein family.<div class="publication01HideAbstract"><a href="javascript:Publications.hideAbstract(28);">hide</a></div></div></div><div id="publication52" class="publication01"><div

  class="publication01Abstract" style="display:none;">Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have a multilineage differentiation potential and provide immunosuppressive and antimicrobial functions. Murine as well as human MSCs restrict the proliferation of T cells. However, species-specific differences in the underlying molecular mechanisms have been described. Here, we analyzed the antiparasitic effector mechanisms active in murine MSCs. Murine MSCs, in contrast to human MSCs, could not restrict the growth of a highly virulent strain of Toxoplasma gondii (BK) after stimulation with IFN-γ. However, the growth of a type II strain of T. gondii (ME49) was strongly inhibited by IFN-γ-activated murine MSCs. Immunity-related GTPases (IRGs) as well as guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs) contributed to this antiparasitic effect. Further analysis showed that IFN-γ-activated mMSCs also inhibit the growth of Neospora caninum, a parasite belonging to the apicomplexan group as well. Detailed studies with murine IFN-γ-activated MSC indicated an involvement in IRGs like Irga6, Irgb6 and Irgd in the inhibition of N. caninum. Additional data showed that, furthermore, GBPs like mGBP1 and mGBP2 could have played a role in the anti-N. caninum effect of murine MSCs. These data underline that MSCs, in addition to their regenerative and immunosuppressive activity, function as antiparasitic effector cells as well. However, IRGs are not present in the human genome, indicating a species-specific difference in anti-T. gondii and anti-N. caninum effect between human and murine MSCs.<div class="publication01HideAbstract"><a href="javascript:Publications.hideAbstract(52);">hide</a></div></div></div><div id="publication55" class="publication01"><div

  class="publication01Abstract" style="display:none;">Toxoplasma gondii uses specialized secretory organelles called rhoptries to deliver virulence determinants into the host cell during parasite invasion. One such determinant called rhoptry protein 18 (ROP18) is a polymorphic serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylates host targets to modulate acute virulence. Following secretion into the host cell, ROP18 traffics to the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) where it is tethered to the cytosolic face of this host-pathogen interface. However, the functional consequences of PVM association are not known. In this report, we show that ROP18 mutants altered in an arginine-rich domain upstream of the kinase domain fail to associate to the PVM following secretion from rhoptries. During infection, host cells upregulate immunity-related GTPases that localize to and destroy the PVM surrounding the parasites. ROP18 disarms this host innate immune pathway by phosphorylating IRGs in a critical GTPase domain and preventing loading on the PVM. Vacuole-targeting mutants of ROP18 failed to phosphorylate Irga6 and were unable to divert IRGs from the PVM, despite retaining intrinsic kinase activity. As a consequence, these mutants were avirulent in a mouse model of acute toxoplasmosis. Thus, the association of ROP18 with the PVM, mediated by its N-terminal arginine-rich domain, is critical to its function as a virulence determinant.<div class="publication01HideAbstract"><a href="javascript:Publications.hideAbstract(55);">hide</a></div></div></div><div id="publication77" class="publication01"><div

  class="publication01Abstract" style="display:none;"><em>Toxoplasma gondii</em> is a zoonotic protozoan parasite which infects nearly one third of the human population and is found in an extraordinary range of vertebrate hosts. Its epidemiology depends heavily on horizontal transmission, especially between rodents and its definitive host, the cat. Neospora caninum is a recently discovered close relative of <em>Toxoplasma</em>, whose definitive host is the dog. Both species are tissue-dwelling Coccidia and members of the phylum Apicomplexa; they share many common features, but Neospora neither infects humans nor shares the same wide host range as Toxoplasma, rather it shows a striking preference for highly efficient vertical transmission in cattle. These species therefore provide a remarkable opportunity to investigate mechanisms of host restriction, transmission strategies, virulence and zoonotic potential. We sequenced the genome of <em>N. caninum</em> and transcriptomes of the invasive stage of both species, undertaking an extensive comparative genomics and transcriptomics analysis. We estimate that these organisms diverged from their common ancestor around 28 million years ago and find that both genomes and gene expression are remarkably conserved. However, in N. caninum we identified an unexpected expansion of surface antigen gene families and the divergence of secreted virulence factors, including rhoptry kinases. Specifically we show that the rhoptry kinase ROP18 is pseudogenised in N. caninum and that, as a possible consequence, Neospora is unable to phosphorylate host immunity-related GTPases, as <em>Toxoplasma</em> does. This defense strategy is thought to be key to virulence in <em>Toxoplasma</em>. We conclude that the ecological niches occupied by these species are influenced by a relatively small number of gene products which operate at the host-parasite interface and that the dominance of vertical transmission in N. caninum may be associated with the evolution of reduced virulence in this species.<div class="publication01HideAbstract"><a href="javascript:Publications.hideAbstract(77);">hide</a></div></div></div><div id="publication81" class="publication01"><div

  class="publication01Abstract" style="display:none;">The ability of mice to resist infection with the protozoan parasite, Toxoplasma gondii, depends in large part on the function of members of a complex family of atypical large GTPases, the interferon-gamma-inducible immunity-related GTPases (IRG proteins). Nevertheless, some strains of T. gondii are highly virulent for mice because, as recently shown, they secrete a polymorphic protein kinase, ROP18, from the rhoptries into the host cell cytosol at the moment of cell invasion. Depending on the allele, ROP18 can act as a virulence factor for T. gondii by phosphorylating and thereby inactivating mouse IRG proteins. In this article we show that IRG proteins interact not only with ROP18, but also strongly with the products of another polymorphic locus, ROP5, already implicated as a major virulence factor from genetic crosses, but whose function has previously been a complete mystery. ROP5 proteins are members of the same protein family as ROP18 kinases but are pseudokinases by sequence, structure, and function. We show by a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches that ROP5 proteins act as essential co-factors for ROP18 and present evidence that they work by enforcing an inactive GDP-dependent conformation on the IRG target protein. By doing so they prevent GTP-dependent activation and simultaneously expose the target threonines on the switch I loop for phosphorylation by ROP18, resulting in permanent inactivation of the protein. This represents a novel mechanism in which a pseudokinase facilitates the phosphorylation of a target by a partner kinase by preparing the substrate for phosphorylation, rather than by upregulation of the activity of the kinase itself.<div class="publication01HideAbstract"><a href="javascript:Publications.hideAbstract(81);">hide</a></div></div></div><div id="publication89" class="publication01"><div

  class="publication01Abstract" style="display:none;">The immunity-related GTPases (IRGs) are a family of proteins induced by interferon-γ that play a crucial role in innate resistance to intracellular pathogens. The M subfamily of IRG proteins (IRGM) plays a profound role in this context, in part because of the ability of its members to regulate the localization and expression of other IRG proteins. We present here evidence that IRGM proteins affect the localization of the guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs), a second family of interferon-induced GTP-binding proteins that also function in innate immunity. Absence of Irgm1 or Irgm3 led to accumulation of Gbp2 in intracellular compartments that were positive for both the macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) marker LC3 and the autophagic adapter molecule p62/Sqstm1. Gbp2 was similarly relocalized in cells in which autophagy was impaired because of the absence of Atg5. Both in Atg5- and IRGM-deficient cells, the IRG protein Irga6 relocalized to the same compartments as Gbp2, raising the possibility of a common regulatory mechanism. However, other data indicated that Irga6, but not Gbp2, was ubiquitinated in IRGM-deficient cells. Similarly, coimmunoprecipitation studies indicated that although Irgm3 did interact directly with Irgb6, it did not interact with Gbp2. Collectively, these data suggest that IRGM proteins indirectly modulate the localization of GBPs through a distinct mechanism from that through which they regulate IRG protein localization. Further, these results suggest that a core function of IRGM proteins is to regulate autophagic flux, which influences the localization of GBPs and possibly other factors that instruct cell-autonomous immune resistance.<div class="publication01HideAbstract"><a href="javascript:Publications.hideAbstract(89);">hide</a></div></div></div><div id="publication93" class="publication01"><div

  class="publication01Abstract" style="display:none;">IRG proteins (immunity-related GTPases) provide an early defense mechanism in mice against the protozoal pathogen, Toxoplasma gondii. This is a particularly suitable time to provide a brief review of this host-pathogen interaction because the nature of the IRG resistance system, and to some extent its mode of action, have become known in the past few years. Likewise, forward genetic screens have recently drawn attention to a number of loci contributing to the differential virulence of T. gondii strains in mice. It is now clear that at least some important virulence mechanisms exert their action against components of the IRG resistance system. Thus these two mechanisms form the two poles of a dynamic host-pathogen virulence-resistance relationship with interesting and accessible properties.<div class="publication01HideAbstract"><a href="javascript:Publications.hideAbstract(93);">hide</a></div></div></div><div id="publication98" class="publication01"><div

  class="publication01Abstract" style="display:none;">Clearance of infection with intracellular pathogens in mice involves interferon-regulated GTPases of the IRG protein family. Experiments with mice genetically deficient in members of this family such as Irgm1(LRG-47), Irgm3(IGTP), and Irgd(IRG-47) has revealed a critical role in microbial clearance, especially for <em>Toxoplasma gondii</em>. The in vivo role of another member of this family, Irga6 (IIGP, IIGP1) has been studied in less detail. We investigated the susceptibility of two independently generated mouse strains deficient in Irga6 to in vivo infection with T. gondii, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Leishmania mexicana, L. major, Listeria monocytogenes, Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Plasmodium berghei. Compared with wild-type mice, mice deficient in Irga6 showed increased susceptibility to oral and intraperitoneal infection with T. gondii but not to infection with the other organisms. Surprisingly, infection of Irga6-deficient mice with the related apicomplexan parasite, P. berghei, did not result in increased replication in the liver stage and no Irga6 (or any other IRG protein) was detected at the parasitophorous vacuole membrane in IFN-γ-induced wild-type cells infected with P. berghei in vitro. Susceptibility to infection with T. gondii was associated with increased mortality and reduced time to death, increased numbers of inflammatory foci in the brains and elevated parasite loads in brains of infected Irga6-deficient mice. In vitro, Irga6-deficient macrophages and fibroblasts stimulated with IFN-γ were defective in controlling parasite replication. Taken together, our results implicate Irga6 in the control of infection with T. gondii and further highlight the importance of the IRG system for resistance to this pathogen.<div class="publication01HideAbstract"><a href="javascript:Publications.hideAbstract(98);">hide</a></div></div></div><div id="publication104" class="publication01"><div

  class="publication01Abstract" style="display:none;">The immunity-related GTPases (IRGs) belong to the family of large, interferon-inducible GTPases and constitute a cell-autonomous resistance system essential for the control of vacuolar pathogens like Toxoplasma gondii in mice. Recent results demonstrated that numerous IRG members accumulate collaboratively at the parasitophorous vacuole of invading T. gondii leading to the destruction of the vacuole and the parasite and subsequent necrotic host cell death. Complex regulatory interactions between different IRG proteins are necessary for these processes. Disturbance of this finely balanced system, e.g., by single genetic deficiency for the important negative regulator Irgm1 or the autophagic regulator Atg5, leads to spontaneous activation of the effector IRG proteins when induced by IFNγ. This activation has cytotoxic consequences resulting in a severe lymphopenia, macrophage defects, and failure of the adaptive immune system in Irgm1-deficient mice. However, alternative functions in phagosome maturation and induction of autophagy have been proposed for Irgm1. The IRG system has been studied primarily in mice, but IRG genes are present throughout the mammalian lineage. Interestingly, the number, type, and diversity of genes present differ greatly even between closely related species, probably reflecting intimate host-pathogen coevolution driven by an armed race between the IRG resistance proteins and pathogen virulence factors. IRG proteins are targets for polymorphic T. gondii virulence factors, and genetic variation in the IRG system between different mouse strains correlates with resistance and susceptibility to virulent T. gondii strains.<div class="publication01HideAbstract"><a href="javascript:Publications.hideAbstract(104);">hide</a></div></div></div><div id="publication107" class="publication01"><div

  class="publication01Abstract" style="display:none;">BACKGROUND:The interferon-inducible immunity-related GTPases (IRG proteins/p47 GTPases) are a distinctive family of GTPases that function as powerful cell-autonomous resistance factors. The IRG protein, Irga6 (IIGP1), participates in the disruption of the vacuolar membrane surrounding the intracellular parasite, Toxoplasma gondii, through which it communicates with its cellular hosts. Some aspects of the protein&apos;s behaviour have suggested a dynamin-like molecular mode of action, in that the energy released by GTP hydrolysis is transduced into mechanical work that results in deformation and ultimately rupture of the vacuolar membrane.RESULTS:Irga6 forms GTP-dependent oligomers in vitro and thereby activates hydrolysis of the GTP substrate. In this study we define the catalytic G-domain interface by mutagenesis and present a structural model, of how GTP hydrolysis is activated in Irga6 complexes, based on the substrate-twinning reaction mechanism of the signal recognition particle (SRP) and its receptor (SRα). In conformity with this model, we show that the bound nucleotide is part of the catalytic interface and that the 3&apos;hydroxyl of the GTP ribose bound to each subunit is essential for trans-activation of hydrolysis of the GTP bound to the other subunit. We show that both positive and negative regulatory interactions between IRG proteins occur via the catalytic interface. Furthermore, mutations that disrupt the catalytic interface also prevent Irga6 from accumulating on the parasitophorous vacuole membrane of T. gondii, showing that GTP-dependent Irga6 activation is an essential component of the resistance mechanism.CONCLUSIONS:The catalytic interface of Irga6 defined in the present experiments can probably be used as a paradigm for the nucleotide-dependent interactions of all members of the large family of IRG GTPases, both activating and regulatory. Understanding the activation mechanism of Irga6 will help to explain the mechanism by which IRG proteins exercise their resistance function. We find no support from sequence or G-domain structure for the idea that IRG proteins and the SRP GTPases have a common phylogenetic origin. It therefore seems probable, if surprising, that the substrate-assisted catalytic mechanism has been independently evolved in the two protein families.<div class="publication01HideAbstract"><a href="javascript:Publications.hideAbstract(107);">hide</a></div></div></div><div id="publication121" class="publication01"><div

  class="publication01Abstract" style="display:none;">The immunity-related GTPases (IRGs) constitute an interferon-induced intracellular resistance mechanism in mice against Toxoplasma gondii. IRG proteins accumulate on the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM), leading to its disruption and to death of the parasite. How IRGs target the PVM is unknown. We show that accumulation of IRGs on the PVM begins minutes after parasite invasion and increases for about 1 h. Targeting occurs independently of several signalling pathways and the microtubule network, suggesting that IRG transport is diffusion-driven. The intensity of IRG accumulation on the PVM, however, is reduced in absence of the autophagy regulator, Atg5. In wild-type cells IRG proteins accumulate cooperatively on PVMs in a definite order reflecting a temporal hierarchy, with Irgb6 and Irgb10 apparently acting as pioneers. Loading of IRG proteins onto the vacuoles of virulent Toxoplasma strains is attenuated and the two pioneer IRGs are the most affected. The polymorphic rhoptry kinases, ROP16, ROP18 and the catalytically inactive proteins, ROP5A-D, are not individually responsible for this effect. Thus IRG proteins protect mice against avirulent strains of Toxoplasma but fail against virulent strains. The complex cooperative behaviour of IRG proteins in resisting Toxoplasma may hint at undiscovered complexity also in virulence mechanisms.<div class="publication01HideAbstract"><a href="javascript:Publications.hideAbstract(121);">hide</a></div></div></div><div id="publication133" class="publication01"><div

  class="publication01Abstract" style="display:none;">Irgm1 (LRG-47) is an interferon-inducible Golgi membrane associated GTPase of the mouse whose disruption causes susceptibility to many different intracellular pathogens. Irgm1 has been variously interpreted as a regulator of homologous effector GTPases of the IRG family, a regulator of phagosome maturation and as an initiator of autophagy in interferon-induced cells. We find that endogenous Irgm1 localises to late endosomal and lysosomal compartments in addition to the Golgi membranes. The targeting motif known to be required for Golgi localisation is surprisingly also required for endolysosomal localisation. However, unlike Golgi localisation, localisation to the endolysosomal system also requires the functional integrity of the nucleotide binding site, and thus probably reflects transient activation. Golgi localisation is lost when Irgm1 is tagged at either N- or C-termini with EGFP, while localisation to the endolysosomal system is relatively favoured. N-terminally tagged Irgm1 localises predominantly to early endosomes, while C-terminally tagged Irgm1 localises to late endosomes and lysosomes. Both these anomalous distributions are reversed by inactivation of the nucleotide binding site, and the tagged proteins both revert to Golgi membrane localisation. Irgm1 is the first IRG protein to be found associated with the endolysosomal membrane system in addition to either Golgi (Irgm1 and Irgm2) or ER (Irgm3) membranes, and we interpret the result to be in favour of a regulatory function of IRGM proteins at cellular membrane systems. In future analyses it should be borne in mind that tagging of Irgm1 leads to loss of Golgi localisation and enhanced localisation on endolysosomal membranes, probably as a result of constitutive activation.<div class="publication01HideAbstract"><a href="javascript:Publications.hideAbstract(133);">hide</a></div></div></div><div id="publication134" class="publication01"><div

  class="publication01Abstract" style="display:none;">Virulence of complex pathogens in mammals is generally determined by multiple components of the pathogen interacting with the functional complexity and multiple layering of the mammalian immune system. It is most unusual for the resistance of a mammalian host to be overcome by the defeat of a single defence mechanism. In this study we uncover and analyse just such a case at the molecular level, involving the widespread intracellular protozoan pathogen Toxoplasma gondii and one of its most important natural hosts, the house mouse (Mus musculus). Natural polymorphism in virulence of Eurasian T. gondii strains for mice has been correlated in genetic screens with the expression of polymorphic rhoptry kinases (ROP kinases) secreted into the host cell during infection. We show that the molecular targets of the virulent allelic form of ROP18 kinase are members of a family of cellular GTPases, the interferon-inducible IRG (immunity-related GTPase) proteins, known from earlier work to be essential resistance factors in mice against avirulent strains of T. gondii. Virulent T. gondii strain ROP18 kinase phosphorylates several mouse IRG proteins. We show that the parasite kinase phosphorylates host Irga6 at two threonines in the nucleotide-binding domain, biochemically inactivating the GTPase and inhibiting its accumulation and action at the T. gondii parasitophorous vacuole membrane. Our analysis identifies the conformationally active switch I region of the GTP-binding site as an Achilles&apos; heel of the IRG protein pathogen-resistance mechanism. The polymorphism of ROP18 in natural T. gondii populations indicates the existence of a dynamic, rapidly evolving ecological relationship between parasite virulence factors and host resistance factors. This system should be unusually fruitful for analysis at both ecological and molecular levels since both T. gondii and the mouse are widespread and abundant in the wild and are well-established model species with excellent analytical tools available.<div class="publication01HideAbstract"><a href="javascript:Publications.hideAbstract(134);">hide</a></div></div></div><div id="publication135" class="publication01"><div

  class="publication01Abstract" style="display:none;">BACKGROUND:Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells differ from other T cells by their hyperactive effector T-cell status, in addition to the expression of NK lineage receptors and semi-invariant T-cell receptors. It is generally agreed that the immune phenotype of iNKT cells is maintained by repeated activation in peripheral tissues although no explicit evidence for such iNKT cell activity in vivo has so far been reported.RESULTS:We used an interferon (IFN)-γ-inducible cytoplasmic protein, Irga6, as a histological marker for local IFN-γ production. Irga6 was intensely expressed in small foci of liver parenchymal cells and kidney tubular epithelium. Focal Irga6 expression was unaffected by germ-free status or loss of TLR signalling and was totally dependent on IFN-γ secreted by T cells in the centres of expression foci. These were shown to be iNKT cells by diagnostic T cell receptor usage and their activity was lost in both CD1 d and Jα-deficient mice.CONCLUSIONS:This is the first report that supplies direct evidence for explicit activation events of NKT cells in vivo and raises issues about the triggering mechanism and consequences for immune functions in liver and kidney.<div class="publication01HideAbstract"><a href="javascript:Publications.hideAbstract(135);">hide</a></div></div></div><div id="publication136" class="publication01"><div

  class="publication01Abstract" style="display:none;">The innate immune system senses bacterial pathogens by pattern recognition receptors, such as the well-characterised Toll-like Receptors (TLR). The activation of TLR signalling cascades depends on several adaptor proteins, among which MyD88 plays a key role in triggering innate immune responses. Here, we show in murine macrophages that Brucella abortus triggers expression of the interferon-inducible resistance proteins (IRGs, p47 GTPases) via type-I IFN secretion at late time points, when Brucella has reached its replication niche. This induction requires the adaptor molecule MyD88 but does not involve the TLRs normally implicated in sensing Gram-negative bacteria, namely TLR2, TLR4, TLR5 and TLR9. Brucella mutants lacking the functional VirB type-IV secretion system were not capable of inducing Irgm3 and Irga6 expression, suggesting that the type-IV secretion system is part of the triggering of the activation process. Our data suggest that Brucella is recognized intracellularly by an unknown receptor, different from the conventional ones used for Gram-negative sensing, but one that nevertheless signals through MyD88.<div class="publication01HideAbstract"><a href="javascript:Publications.hideAbstract(138);">hide</a></div></div></div><div id="publication145" class="publication01"><div

  class="publication01Abstract" style="display:none;">The immunity-related GTPases (IRG), also known as p47 GTPases, are a family of proteins that are tightly regulated by IFNs at the transcriptional level and serve as key mediators of IFN-regulated resistance to intracellular bacteria and protozoa. Among the IRG proteins, loss of Irgm1 has the most profound impact on IFN-gamma-induced host resistance at the physiological level. Surprisingly, the losses of host resistance seen in the absence of Irgm1 are sometimes more striking than those seen in the absence of IFN-gamma. In the current work, we address the underlying mechanism. We find that in several contexts, another protein in the IRG family, Irgm3, functions to counter the effects of Irgm1. By creating mice that lack Irgm1 and Irgm3, we show that several phenotypes important to host resistance that are caused by Irgm1 deficiency are reversed by coincident Irgm3 deficiency; these include resistance to Salmonella typhimurium in vivo, the ability to affect IFN-gamma-induced Salmonella killing in isolated macrophages, and the ability to regulate macrophage adhesion and motility in vitro. Other phenotypes that are caused by Irgm1 deficiency, including susceptibility to Toxoplasma gondii and the regulation of GKS IRG protein expression and localization, are not reversed but exacerbated when Irgm3 is also absent. These data suggest that members of the Irgm subfamily within the larger IRG family possess activities that can be opposing or cooperative depending on the context, and it is the balance of these activities that is pivotal in mediating IFN-gamma-regulated host resistance.<div class="publication01HideAbstract"><a href="javascript:Publications.hideAbstract(145);">hide</a></div></div></div><div id="publication146" class="publication01"><div

  class="publication01Abstract" style="display:none;">Immunity-related GTPases (IRG) play an important role in defense against intracellular pathogens. One member of this gene family in humans, IRGM, has been recently implicated as a risk factor for Crohn&apos;s disease. We analyzed the detailed structure of this gene family among primates and showed that most of the IRG gene cluster was deleted early in primate evolution, after the divergence of the anthropoids from prosimians ( about 50 million years ago). Comparative sequence analysis of New World and Old World monkey species shows that the single-copy IRGM gene became pseudogenized as a result of an Alu retrotransposition event in the anthropoid common ancestor that disrupted the open reading frame (ORF). We find that the ORF was reestablished as a part of a polymorphic stop codon in the common ancestor of humans and great apes. Expression analysis suggests that this change occurred in conjunction with the insertion of an endogenous retrovirus, which altered the transcription initiation, splicing, and expression profile of IRGM. These data argue that the gene became pseudogenized and was then resurrected through a series of complex structural events and suggest remarkable functional plasticity where alleles experience diverse evolutionary pressures over time. Such dynamism in structure and evolution may be critical for a gene family locked in an arms race with an ever-changing repertoire of intracellular parasites.<div class="publication01HideAbstract"><a href="javascript:Publications.hideAbstract(148);">hide</a></div></div></div><div id="publication151" class="publication01"><div

  class="publication01Abstract" style="display:none;">The Immunity Related GTPases (IRG proteins) constitute a large family of interferon-inducible proteins that mediate early resistance to Toxoplasma gondii infection in mice. At least six members of this family are required for resistance of mice to virulent T. gondii strains. Recent results have shown that the complexity of the resistance arises from complex regulatory interactions between different family members. The mode of action against T. gondii depends on the ability of IRG proteins to accumulate on the parasitophorous vacuole of invading tachyzoites and to induce local damage to the vacuole resulting in disruption of the vacuolar membrane. Virulent strains of T. gondii overcome the IRG resistance system, probably by interfering with the loading of IRG proteins onto the parasitophorous vacuole membrane. It may be assumed that T. gondii strains highly virulent for mice will be disadvantaged in the wild due to the rapid extinction of the infected host, while it is self-evident that susceptibility to virulent strains is disadvantageous to the mouse host. We consider the possibility that this double disadvantage is compensated in wild populations by segregating alleles with different resistance and susceptibility properties in the IRG system.<div class="publication01HideAbstract"><a href="javascript:Publications.hideAbstract(151);">hide</a></div></div></div><div id="publication155" class="publication01"><div

  class="publication01Abstract" style="display:none;">Members of the immunity-related GTPase (IRG) family are interferon-inducible resistance factors against a broad spectrum of intracellular pathogens including Toxoplasma gondii. The molecular mechanisms governing the function and regulation of the IRG resistance system are largely unknown. We find that IRG proteins function in a system of direct, nucleotide-dependent regulatory interactions between family members. After interferon induction but before infection, the three members of the GMS subfamily of IRG proteins, Irgm1, Irgm2 and Irgm3, which possess an atypical nucleotide-binding site, regulate the intracellular positioning of the conventional GKS subfamily members, Irga6 and Irgb6. Following infection, the normal accumulation of Irga6 protein at the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) is nucleotide dependent and also depends on the presence of all three GMS proteins. We present evidence that an essential role of the GMS proteins in this response is control of the nucleotide-bound state of the GKS proteins, preventing their GTP-dependent activation before infection. Accumulation of IRG proteins at the PVM has previously been shown to be associated with a block in pathogen replication: our results relate for the first time the enzymatic properties of IRG proteins to their role in pathogen resistance.<div class="publication01HideAbstract"><a href="javascript:Publications.hideAbstract(164);">hide</a></div></div></div><div id="publication169" class="publication01"><div

In mouse cells, IFN-gamma can effectively restrict growth of the human pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis but fails to control growth of the closely related mouse pathogen Chlamydia muridarum. The ability of mouse cells to resist C. trachomatis replication is largely dependent on the induction of a family of IFN-gamma-inducible GTPases called immunity-related GTPases or IRGs. In this study we demonstrate that C. muridarum can specifically evade IRG-mediated host resistance. It has previously been suggested that C. muridarum inactivates the IRG protein Irga6 (Iigp1) to dampen the murine immune response. However, we show that Irga6 is dispensable for the control of C. trachomatis replication. Instead, an effective IFN-gamma response to C. trachomatis requires the IRG proteins Irgm1 (Lrg47), Irgm3 (Igtp), and Irgb10. Ectopic expression of Irgb10 in the absence of IFN-gamma is sufficient to reduce intracellular growth of C. trachomatis but fails to restrict growth of C. muridarum, indicating that C. muridarum can specifically evade Irgb10-driven host responses. Importantly, we find that Irgb10 protein intimately associates with inclusions harboring C. trachomatis but is absent from inclusions formed by C. muridarum. These data suggest that C. muridarum has evolved a mechanism to escape the murine IFN-gamma response by restricting access of Irgb10 and possibly other IRG proteins to the inclusion.<div class="publication01HideAbstract"><a href="javascript:Publications.hideAbstract(169);">hide</a></div></div></div><div id="publication181" class="publication01"><div

  class="publication01Abstract" style="display:none;">The IRG proteins (p47 GTPases) constitute one of the strongest resistance systems known to be active against intracellular pathogens in mice. The proteins are induced by interferons and assemble on phagosomes and parasitophorous vacuoles of a number of different micro-organisms in all cell types assayed. There are presently three experimentally based views as to how they exert their cell-autonomous activity against intracellular pathogens: blocking of interferon-mediated acceleration of phagosome maturation, induction of autophagic membranes, and direct destruction of the parasitophorous vacuole membrane. Failure of hemopoietic stem cells during infection is associated with targeted deletion of one IRG protein, Irgm1. The significance of this non-cell-autonomous phenotype is discussed.<div class="publication01HideAbstract"><a href="javascript:Publications.hideAbstract(181);">hide</a></div></div></div><div id="publication184" class="publication01"><div

  class="publication01Abstract" style="display:none;">Mammalian cells respond to interferons (IFNs) secreted during infection by the transcriptional upregulation of as many as a thousand genes. This remarkable transition prepares cells and organisms for resistance to infection, and many IFN-regulated gene products are players in well-understood resistance programs. Oddly, however, many of the most abundantly induced proteins are GTPases whose functions are not well understood. Here we review the progress that has been made toward understanding the roles of individual GTPase families in disease resistance and the hints of common mechanisms that are now available.<div class="publication01HideAbstract"><a href="javascript:Publications.hideAbstract(213);">hide</a></div></div></div><div id="publication215" class="publication01"><div

  class="publication01Abstract" style="display:none;">The p47 GTPases are essential for interferon-gamma-induced cell-autonomous immunity against the protozoan parasite, Toxoplasma gondii, in mice, but the mechanism of resistance is poorly understood. We show that the p47 GTPases, including IIGP1, accumulate at vacuoles containing T. gondii. The accumulation is GTP-dependent and requires live parasites. Vacuolar IIGP1 accumulations undergo a maturation-like process accompanied by vesiculation of the parasitophorous vacuole membrane. This culminates in disruption of the parasitophorous vacuole and finally of the parasite itself. Over-expression of IIGP1 leads to accelerated vacuolar disruption whereas a dominant negative form of IIGP1 interferes with interferon-gamma-mediated killing of intracellular parasites. Targeted deletion of the IIGP1 gene results in partial loss of the IFN-gamma-mediated T. gondii growth restriction in mouse astrocytes.<div class="publication01HideAbstract"><a href="javascript:Publications.hideAbstract(215);">hide</a></div></div></div><div id="publication220" class="publication01"><div

  class="publication01Abstract" style="display:none;">BACKGROUND:Members of the p47 (immunity-related GTPases (IRG) family) GTPases are essential, interferon-inducible resistance factors in mice that are active against a broad spectrum of important intracellular pathogens. Surprisingly, there are no reports of p47 function in humans.RESULTS:Here we show that the p47 GTPases are represented by 23 genes in the mouse, whereas humans have only a single full-length p47 GTPase and an expressed, truncated presumed pseudo-gene. The human full-length gene is orthologous to an isolated mouse p47 GTPase that carries no interferon-inducible elements in the promoter of either species and is expressed constitutively in the mature testis of both species. Thus, there is no evidence for a p47 GTPase-based resistance system in humans. Dogs have several interferon-inducible p47s, and so the primate lineage that led to humans appears to have lost an ancient function. Multiple p47 GTPases are also present in the zebrafish, but there is only a tandem p47 gene pair in pufferfish.CONCLUSION:Mice and humans must deploy their immune resources against vacuolar pathogens in radically different ways. This carries significant implications for the use of the mouse as a model of human infectious disease. The absence of the p47 resistance system in humans suggests that possession of this resistance system carries significant costs that, in the primate lineage that led to humans, are not outweighed by the benefits. The origin of the vertebrate p47 system is obscure.<div class="publication01HideAbstract"><a href="javascript:Publications.hideAbstract(220);">hide</a></div></div></div>
