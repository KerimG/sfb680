		  Toll-dependent patterning of the dorsoventral axis in Drosophila represents one of the best understood gene regulatory networks. However, its evolutionary origin has remained elusive. Outside the insects Toll is not known for a patterning function, but rather for a role in pathogen defense. Here, we show that in the milkweed bug Oncopeltus fasciatus, whose lineage split from Drosophila's more than 350 million years ago, Toll is only required to polarize a dynamic BMP signaling network. A theoretical model reveals that this network has self-regulatory properties and that shallow Toll signaling gradients are sufficient to initiate axis formation. Such gradients can account for the experimentally observed twinning of insect embryos upon egg fragmentation and might have evolved from a state of uniform Toll activity associated with protecting insect eggs against pathogens.

		  Genetic screens are powerful tools to identify the genes required for a given biological process. However, for technical reasons, comprehensive screens have been restricted to very few model organisms. Therefore, although deep sequencing is revealing the genes of ever more insect species, the functional studies predominantly focus on candidate genes previously identified in Drosophila, which is biasing research towards conserved gene functions. RNAi screens in other organisms promise to reduce this bias. Here we present the results of the iBeetle screen, a large-scale, unbiased RNAi screen in the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, which identifies gene functions in embryonic and postembryonic development, physiology and cell biology. The utility of Tribolium as a screening platform is demonstrated by the identification of genes involved in insect epithelial adhesion. This work transcends the restrictions of the candidate gene approach and opens fields of research not accessible in Drosophila.

                    Morphogenesis involves the dynamic reorganization of cell and tissue shapes to create the
                    three-dimensional body. Intriguingly, different species have evolved different morphogenetic
                    processes to achieve the same general outcomes during embryonic development. How are meaningful
                    comparisons between species made, and where do the differences lie? In this Perspective, we argue
                    that examining the evolution of embryonic morphogenesis requires the simultaneous consideration of
                    different levels of biological organization: (1) genes, (2) cells, (3) tissues, and (4) the entire
                    egg, or other gestational context. To illustrate the importance of integrating these levels, we use
                    the extraembryonic epithelia of insects—a lineage-specific innovation and evolutionary hotspot—as an
                    exemplary case study. We discuss how recent functional data, primarily from RNAi experiments
                    targeting the Hox3/Zen and U-shaped group transcription factors, provide insights into developmental
                    processes at all four levels. Comparisons of these data from several species both challenge and
                    inform our understanding of homology, in assessing how the process of epithelial morphogenesis has
                    itself evolved.

                     class="publication01Abstract" style="display:none;">Extracellular DNA is an important structural
                    component of many bacterial biofilms. It is unknown, however, to which extent external DNA is used
                    to transfer genes by means of transformation. Here, we quantified the acquisition of multi-drug
                    resistance and visualized its spread under selective and non-selective conditions in biofilms formed
                    by Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Density and architecture of the biofilms were controlled by
                    microstructuring the substratum for bacterial adhesion. Horizontal transfer of antibiotic-resistance
                    genes between co-cultured strains, each carrying a single resistance, occurred efficiently in early
                    biofilms. The efficiency of gene transfer was higher in early biofilms than between planktonic
                    cells. It was strongly reduced after 24 h and independent of biofilm density. Pilin antigenic
                    variation caused a high fraction of non-piliated bacteria but was not responsible for the reduced
                    gene transfer at later stages. When selective pressure was applied to dense biofilms using
                    antibiotics at their MIC, the double-resistant bacteria did not show a significant growth advantage.
                    In loosely-connected biofilms, the spreading of double-resistant clones was prominent. We conclude
                    that multi-drug resistance readily develops in early gonococcal biofilms through horizontal gene
                    transfer. However, selection and spreading of the multi-resistant clones is heavily suppressed in
                    dense biofilms

                    adhesion to surfaces, motility, microcolony formation, and horizontal gene transfer in many
                    bacterial species. These polymers are strong molecular motors that can retract at two different
                    speeds. In the human pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae speed switching of single pili from 2 µm/s to 1
                    µm/s can be triggered by oxygen depletion. Here, we address the question how proton motive force
                    (PMF) influences motor speed. Using pHluorin expression in combination with dyes that are sensitive
                    to transmembrane ΔpH gradient or transmembrane potential ΔΨ, we measured both components of the PMF
                    at varying external pH. Depletion of PMF using uncouplers reversibly triggered switching into the
                    low speed mode. Reduction of the PMF by ≈ 35 mV was enough to trigger speed switching. Reducing ATP
                    levels by inhibition of the ATP synthase did not induce speed switching. Furthermore, we showed that
                    the strictly aerobic Myxococcus xanthus failed to move upon depletion of PMF or oxygen, indicating
                    that although the mechanical properties of the motor are conserved, its regulatory inputs have
                    evolved differently. We conclude that depletion of PMF triggers speed switching of gonococcal pili.
                    Although ATP is required for gonococcal pilus retraction, our data indicate that PMF is an
                    independent additional energy source driving the high speed mode.
