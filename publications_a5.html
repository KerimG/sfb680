  class="publication01Abstract" style="display:none;">The growth of land plants depends on stem cell-containing meristems which show major differences in their architecture from basal to higher plant species. In Arabidopsis, the stem cell niches in the shoot and root meristems are promoted by WUSCHEL (WUS) and WOX5, respectively. Both genes are members of a non-ancestral clade of the WUS-related homeobox (WOX) gene family, which is absent in extant bryophytes and lycophytes. Our analyses of five fern species suggest that a single WUS orthologue was present in the last common ancestor (LCA) of leptosporangiate ferns and seed plants. In the extant fern Ceratopteris richardii, the WUS pro-orthologue marks the pluripotent cell fate of immediate descendants of the root apical initial, so-called merophytes, which undergo a series of stereotypic cell divisions and give rise to all cell types of the root except the root cap. The invention of a WUS-like function within the WOX gene family in an ancestor of leptosporangiate ferns and seed plants and its amplification and sub-functionalisation to different stem cell niches might relate to the success of seed plants, especially angiosperms.<div class="publication01HideAbstract"><a href="javascript:Publications.hideAbstract(50);">hide</a></div></div></div><div class="publication01"><div

  class="publication01Abstract" style="display:none;">The morphologically diverse bodies of seed plants comprising gymnosperms and angiosperms, which separated some 350 Ma, grow by the activity of meristems containing stem cell niches. In the dicot model Arabidopsis thaliana, these are maintained by the stem cell-promoting functions of WUS and WUSCHEL-related homeobox 5 (WOX5) in the shoot and the root, respectively. Both genes are members of the WOX gene family, which has a monophyletic origin in green algae. The establishment of the WOX gene phylogeny from basal land plants through gymnosperms to basal and higher angiosperms reveals three major branches: a basal clade consisting of WOX13-related genes present in some green algae and throughout all land plant genomes, a second clade containing WOX8/9/11/12 homologues, and a modern clade restricted to seed plants. The analysis of the origin of the modern branch in two basal angiosperms (Amborella trichopoda and Nymphaea jamesoniana) and three gymnosperms (Pinus sylvestris, Ginkgo biloba, and Gnetum gnemon) shows that all members of the modern clade consistently found in monocots and dicots exist at the base of the angiosperm lineage, including WUS and WOX5 orthologues. In contrast, our analyses identify a single WUS/WOX5 homologue in all three gymnosperm genomes, consistent with a monophyletic origin in the last common ancestor of gymnosperms and angiosperms. Phylogenetic data, WUS- and WOX5-specific evolutionary signatures, as well as the expression pattern and stem cell-promoting function of the single gymnosperm WUS/WOX5 pro-orthologue in Arabidopsis indicate a gene duplication event followed by subfunctionalization at the base of angiosperms.<div class="publication01HideAbstract"><a href="javascript:Publications.hideAbstract(112);">hide</a></div></div></div><div class="publication01"><div

  class="publication01Abstract" style="display:none;">Arabidopsis thaliana has become a paradigm for dicot embryo development, despite its embryology being non-representative of dicots in general. The recent cloning of heterologous genes involved in embryonic development from maize and construction of robust phylogenies has shed light on the conservation of transcription factor function and now facilitates a comparison of maize and Arabidopsis embryogenesis orthology. In this review, we focus on a comparison of expression domains of WUSCHEL HOMEOBOX LIKE (WOX), SHOOTMERISTEMLESS (STM), DORNROESCHEN (DRN) and CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON (CUC) genes and their role in axialization in both species, showing that despite significantly divergent modes of embryogenesis, most notably in terms of axes and planes of symmetry, there is considerable conservation of function as well as notable differences between maize and Arabidopsis.<div class="publication01HideAbstract"><a href="javascript:Publications.hideAbstract(146);">hide</a></div></div></div><div class="publication01"><div

  class="publication01Abstract" style="display:none;">Genetic and molecular analyses in the dicot model plant Arabidopsis thaliana have begun to shed some light on regulatory networks in plants. However, comparisons with other species are necessary to validate networks identified in model species on the evolutionary scale. Many key regulatory proteins are encoded by members of transcription factor gene families. Orthologous genes can be identified by phylogenetic reconstructions based on conserved protein domains and functionally substantiated by gene expression patterns and mutant analyses. Recent comparative analyses of different pathways involved in shoot meristem development reveal not only conservation from basal land plants to angiosperms but also evolutionary freedom for significant adaptations in the course of plant speciation.<div class="publication01HideAbstract"><a href="javascript:Publications.hideAbstract(152);">hide</a></div></div></div><div class="publication01"><div

  class="publication01Abstract" style="display:none;">The phylogeny based on the homeodomain (HD) amino acid sequence of the WOX (WUSCHEL-related homeobox gene family) was established in the 3 major radiations of the Poaceae family: Pooideae (Brachypodium distachyon), Bambusoideae (Oryza sativa), and Panicoideae (Zea mays). The genomes of all 3 grasses contain an ancient duplication in the WOX3 branch, and the cellular expression patterns in maize and rice indicate subfunctionalization of paralogues during leaf development, which may relate to the architecture of the grass leaf and the encircling of the stem. The use of maize WOX gene family members as molecular markers in maize embryo development for the first time allowed us to visualize cellular decisions in the maize proembryo, including specification of the shoot/root axis at an oblique angle to the apical-basal polarity of the zygote. All molecular marker data are compatible with the conclusion that the embryonic shoot/root axis comprises a discrete domain from early proembryo stages onward. Novel cell fates of the shoot and the root are acquired within this distinct morphogenic axis domain, which elongates and thus separates the shoot apical meristem and root apical meristem (RAM) anlagen in the maize embryo.<div class="publication01HideAbstract"><a href="javascript:Publications.hideAbstract(156);">hide</a></div></div></div><div class="publication01"><div

  class="publication01Abstract" style="display:none;">A potential orthologue of the Arabidopsis DORNROSCHEN (DRN) gene was isolated from maize based on phylogeny and expression patterns. ZmDRN transcription provides a new marker for embryonic patterning and cellular differentiation in the shoot apical meristem. In contrast to DRN expression in the 2-4-cell Arabidopsis embryo, transcription of the maize orthologue is activated only in the late proembryo stage where expression, however, marks the prospective scutellum domain such as DRN transcription prepatterns cotyledon development in the Arabidopsis globular embryo. The scutellum is commonly considered to be the grass specific organ, which is homologous to the pair of cotyledons in dicots. Such as in Arabidopsis, ZmDRN transcriptional activity is linked to the anlagen of new lateral organs in the maize apex. Striking with respect to the timing of cellular decisions during leaf initiation is asymmetry established between adjacent cells at the very tip of the shoot apical meristem.<div class="publication01HideAbstract"><a href="javascript:Publications.hideAbstract(167);">hide</a></div></div></div><div class="publication01"><div

  class="publication01Abstract" style="display:none;">In Arabidopsis, stem cell homeostasis in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) is controlled by a feedback loop between WUS and CLV functions. We have identified WUS orthologues in maize and rice by a detailed phylogenetic analysis of the WOX gene family and subsequent cloning. A single WUS orthologue is present in the rice genome (OsWUS), whereas the allotetraploid maize genome contains 2 WUS paralogues (ZmWUS1 and ZmWUS2). None of the isolated grass WUS orthologues displays an organizing center-type expression pattern in the vegetative SAM as in Arabidopsis. In contrast, the grass-specific expression patterns relate to the specification of new phytomers consistent with the transcriptional expression patterns of TD1 and FON1 (CLV1 orthologues of maize and rice, respectively). Moreover, the grass WUS and CLV1 orthologues are coexpressed in all reproductive meristems, where fasciation and supernumerary floral organs occur in td1 or fon1 loss-of-function mutants. The expression patterns of WUS orthologues in both grass species compared with those of dicots imply that major changes in WUS function, which are correlated with changes in CLV1 signaling, have occurred during angiosperm evolution and raise doubts about the uniqueness of the WUS/CLV antagonism in the maintenance of the shoot stem cell niche in grasses.<div class="publication01HideAbstract"><a href="javascript:Publications.hideAbstract(170);">hide</a></div></div></div><div class="publication01"><div

  class="publication01Abstract" style="display:none;">All aerial parts of a higher plant originate from the shoot apical meristem (SAM), which is initiated during embryogenesis as a part of the basic body plan. In contrast to dicot species, the SAM in Zea mays is not established at an apico-central, but at a lateral position of the transition stage embryo. Genetic and molecular studies in dicots have revealed that members of the NAC gene family of plant-specific transcription factors such as NO APICAL MERISTEM (NAM) from Petunia or the CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON (CUC) genes from Arabidopsis contribute essential functions to the establishment of the SAM and cotyledon separation. As an approach to the understanding of meristem formation in a monocot species, members of the maize NAC family highly related to the NAM/CUC genes were isolated and characterized. Our phylogenetic analysis indicates that two distinct NAM and CUC3 precursors already existed prior to the separation of mono- and dicot species. The allocation of the two maize paralogues, ZmNAM1 and ZmNAM2 together with PhNAM, AtCUC2 and AmCUP in one sub-branch and the corresponding expression patterns support their contribution to SAM establishment. In contrast, the ZmCUC3 orthologue is associated with boundary specification at the SAM periphery, where it visualizes which fraction of cells in the SAM is committed to a new leaf primordium. Other maize NAC gene family members are clearly positioned outside of this NAM/CUC3 branch and also exhibit highly cell type-specific expression patterns.<div class="publication01HideAbstract"><a href="javascript:Publications.hideAbstract(187);">hide</a></div></div></div><div class="publication01"><div

  class="publication01Abstract" style="display:none;">Development in higher plants depends on the activity of meristems, formative regions that continuously initiate new organs at their flanks. Meristems must maintain a balance between stem cell renewal and organ initiation. In fasciated mutants, organ initiation fails to keep pace with meristem proliferation. The thick tassel dwarf1 (td1) mutation of maize affects both male and female inflorescence development. The female inflorescence, which results in the ear, is fasciated, with extra rows of kernels. The male inflorescence, or tassel, shows an increase in spikelet density. Floral meristems are also affected in td1 mutants; for example, male florets have an increase in stamen number. These results suggest that td1 functions in the inflorescence to limit meristem size. In addition, td1 mutants are slightly shorter than normal siblings, indicating that td1 also plays a role in vegetative development. td1 encodes a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK) that is a putative ortholog of the Arabidopsis CLAVATA1 protein. These results complement previous work showing that fasciated ear2 encodes a CLAVATA2-like protein, and suggest that the CLAVATA signaling pathway is conserved in monocots. td1 maps in the vicinity of quantitative trait loci that affect seed row number, spikelet density and plant height. We discuss the possible selection pressures on td1 during maize domestication.<div class="publication01HideAbstract"><a href="javascript:Publications.hideAbstract(189);">hide</a></div></div></div><div class="publication01"><div

  class="publication01Abstract" style="display:none;">The narrow sheath (ns) phenotype of maize is a duplicate factor trait conferred by mutations at the unlinked loci ns1 and ns2. Recessive mutations at each locus together confer the phenotypic deletion of a lateral compartment in maize leaves and leaf homologs. Previous analyses revealed that the mediolateral axis of maize leaves is comprised of at least two distinct compartments, and suggest a model whereby NS function is required to recruit leaf founder cells from a lateral compartment of maize meristems. Genomic clones of two maize homeodomain-encoding genes were isolated by homology to the WUSCHEL-related gene PRESSED FLOWER (PRS). PRS is required for lateral sepal development in Arabidopsis, although no leaf phenotype is reported. Co-segregation of the ns phenotype with multiple mutant alleles of two maize PRS homologs confirms their allelism to ns1 and ns2. Analyses of NS protein accumulation verify that the ns-R mutations are null alleles. ns transcripts are detected in two lateral foci within maize meristems, and in the margins of lateral organ primordia. Whereas ns1 and ns2 transcripts accumulate to equivalent levels in shoot meristems of vegetative seedlings, ns2 transcripts predominate in female inflorescences. Previously undiscovered phenotypes in the pressed flower mutant support a model whereby the morphology of eudicot leaves and monocot grass leaves has evolved via the differential elaboration of upper versus lower leaf zones. A model implicating an evolutionarily conserved NS/PRS function during recruitment of organ founder cells from a lateral domain of plant meristems is discussed.<div class="publication01HideAbstract"><a href="javascript:Publications.hideAbstract(192);">hide</a></div></div></div>
