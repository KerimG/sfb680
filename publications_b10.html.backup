  class="publication01Abstract" style="display:none;">Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a conserved eukaryotic RNA surveillance mechanism that degrades aberrant mRNAs. NMD impairment in Arabidopsis is linked to constitutive immune response activation and enhanced antibacterial resistance, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here we show that NMD contributes to innate immunity in Arabidopsis by controlling the turnover of numerous TIR domain-containing, nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat (TNL) immune receptor-encoding mRNAs. Autoimmunity resulting from NMD impairment depends on TNL signaling pathway components and can be triggered through deregulation of a single TNL gene, RPS6. Bacterial infection of plants causes host-programmed inhibition of NMD, leading to stabilization of NMD-regulated TNL transcripts. Conversely, constitutive NMD activity prevents TNL stabilization and impairs plant defense, demonstrating that host-regulated NMD contributes to disease resistance. Thus, NMD shapes plant innate immunity by controlling the threshold for activation of TNL resistance pathways.<div class="publication01HideAbstract"><a href="javascript:Publications.hideAbstract(4);">hide</a></div></div></div><div id="publication36" class="publication01"><div

  class="publication01Abstract" style="display:none;">Survival of plants at low temperature depends on mechanisms for limiting physiological damage and maintaining growth. We mapped the chs1-1 (chilling sensitive1-1) mutation in Arabidopsis accession Columbia to the TIR-NBS gene At1g17610. In chs1-1, a single amino acid exchange at the CHS1 N-terminus close to the conserved TIR domain creates a stable mutant protein that fails to protect leaves against chilling stress. The sequence of another TIR-NBS gene (At5g40090) named CHL1 (CHS1-like 1) is related to that of CHS1. Over-expression of CHS1 or CHL1 alleviates chilling damage and enhances plant growth at moderate (24°C) and chilling (13°C) temperatures, suggesting a role for both proteins in growth homeostasis. chs1-1 mutants show induced salicylic acid production and defense gene expression at 13°C, indicative of autoimmunity. Genetic analysis of chs1-1 in combination with defense pathway mutants shows that chs1-1 chilling sensitivity requires the TIR-NBS-LRR and basal resistance regulators encoded by EDS1 and PAD4 but not salicylic acid. By following the timing of metabolic, physiological and chloroplast ultrastructural changes in chs1-1 leaves during chilling, we have established that alterations in photosynthetic complexes and thylakoid membrane integrity precede leaf cell death measured by ion leakage. At 24°C, the chs1-1 mutant appears normal but produces a massive necrotic response to virulent Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato infection, although this does not affect bacterial proliferation. Our results suggest that CHS1 acts at an intersection between temperature sensing and biotic stress pathway activation to maintain plant performance over a range of conditions.<div class="publication01HideAbstract"><a href="javascript:Publications.hideAbstract(36);">hide</a></div></div></div><div id="publication53" class="publication01"><div

  class="publication01Abstract" style="display:none;">In a chemical genetics screen we identified the small-molecule [5-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)furan-2-yl]-piperidine-1-ylmethanethione (DFPM) that triggers rapid inhibition of early abscisic acid signal transduction via PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT4 (PAD4)- and ENHANCED DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY1 (EDS1)-dependent immune signaling mechanisms. However, mechanisms upstream of EDS1 and PAD4 in DFPM-mediated signaling remain unknown. Here, we report that DFPM generates an Arabidopsis thaliana accession-specific root growth arrest in Columbia-0 (Col-0) plants. The genetic locus responsible for this natural variant, VICTR (VARIATION IN COMPOUND TRIGGERED ROOT growth response), encodes a TIR-NB-LRR (for Toll-Interleukin1 Receptor–nucleotide binding–Leucine-rich repeat) protein. Analyses of T-DNA insertion victr alleles showed that VICTR is necessary for DFPM-induced root growth arrest and inhibition of abscisic acid–induced stomatal closing. Transgenic expression of the Col-0 VICTR allele in DFPM-insensitive Arabidopsis accessions recapitulated the DFPM-induced root growth arrest. EDS1 and PAD4, both central regulators of basal resistance and effector-triggered immunity, as well as HSP90 chaperones and their cochaperones RAR1 and SGT1B, are required for the DFPM-induced root growth arrest. Salicylic acid and jasmonic acid signaling pathway components are dispensable. We further demonstrate that VICTR associates with EDS1 and PAD4 in a nuclear protein complex. These findings show a previously unexplored association between a TIR-NB-LRR protein and PAD4 and identify functions of plant immune signaling components in the regulation of root meristematic zone-targeted growth arrest.<div class="publication01HideAbstract"><a href="javascript:Publications.hideAbstract(53);">hide</a></div></div></div><div id="publication72" class="publication01"><div

  class="publication01Abstract" style="display:none;">The species within the now well-defined Arabidopsis genus provide biological materials suitable to investigate speciation and the development of reproductive isolation barriers between related species. Even within the model species A. thaliana, genetic differentiation between populations due to environmental adaptation or demographic history can lead to cases where hybrids between accessions are non-viable. Experimental evidence supports the importance of genome duplications and genetic epistatic interactions in the occurrence of reproductive isolation. Other examples of adaptation to specific environments can be found in Arabidopsis relatives where hybridization and chromosome doubling lead to new amphidiploid species. Molecular signals of speciation found in the Arabidopsis genus should provide a better understanding of speciation processes in plants from a genetic, molecular and evolutionary perspective.<div class="publication01HideAbstract"><a href="javascript:Publications.hideAbstract(72);">hide</a></div></div></div><div id="publication85" class="publication01"><div

  class="publication01Abstract" style="display:none;">Plants have evolved polymorphic immune receptors to recognize pathogens causing disease. However, triggering of resistance needs to be tuned to the local environment to maintain a balance between defense and growth. We consider here the impact of temperature as a key environmental factor influencing immune pathway activation in Arabidopsis. Genetic compensatory and molecular buffering mechanisms affecting the diversification, functionality and subcellular dynamics of immune receptors, reveal multiple points at which temperature intersects with host resistance signaling systems, including a role of at least one receptor in sensing temperature change. Analysis of temperature-dependent autoimmunity caused by allelic mismatches in hybrids of evolutionary diverged Arabidopsis accessions is illuminating processes by which plants maintain &apos;poise&apos; between immune responsiveness and fitness in natural populations.<div class="publication01HideAbstract"><a href="javascript:Publications.hideAbstract(85);">hide</a></div></div></div><div id="publication92" class="publication01"><div

  class="publication01Abstract" style="display:none;">There is now ample evidence that plant development, responses to abiotic environments, and immune responses are tightly intertwined in their physiology. Thus optimization of the immune system during evolution will occur in coordination with that of plant development. Two alternative and possibly complementary forces are at play: genetic constraints due to the pleiotropic action of players in both systems, and coevolution, if developmental changes modulate the cost-benefit balance of immunity. A current challenge is to elucidate the ecological forces driving evolution of quantitative variation for defense at molecular level. The analysis of natural co-variation for developmental and immunity traits in Arabidopsis thaliana promises to bring important insights.<div class="publication01HideAbstract"><a href="javascript:Publications.hideAbstract(92);">hide</a></div></div></div><div id="publication110" class="publication01"><div

  class="publication01Abstract" style="display:none;">Accumulation of genetic incompatibilities within species can lead to reproductive isolation and, potentially, speciation. In this study, we show that allelic variation at SRF3 (Strubbelig Receptor Family 3), encoding a receptor-like kinase, conditions the occurrence of incompatibility between Arabidopsis thaliana accessions. The geographical distribution of SRF3 alleles reveals that allelic forms causing epistatic incompatibility with a Landsberg erecta allele at the RPP1 resistance locus are present in A. thaliana accessions in central Asia. Incompatible SRF3 alleles condition for an enhanced early immune response to pathogens as compared to the resistance-dampening effect of compatible SRF3 forms in isogenic backgrounds. Variation in disease susceptibility suggests a basis for the molecular patterns of a recent selective sweep detected at the SRF3 locus in central Asian populations.<div class="publication01HideAbstract"><a href="javascript:Publications.hideAbstract(110);">hide</a></div></div></div><div id="publication120" class="publication01"><div

  class="publication01Abstract" style="display:none;">An important layer of plant innate immunity to host-adapted pathogens is conferred by intracellular nucleotide-binding/oligomerization domain-leucine rich repeat (NB-LRR) receptors recognizing specific microbial effectors. Signaling from activated receptors of the TIR (Toll/Interleukin-1 Receptor)-NB-LRR class converges on the nucleo-cytoplasmic immune regulator EDS1 (Enhanced Disease Susceptibility1). In this report we show that a receptor-stimulated increase in accumulation of nuclear EDS1 precedes or coincides with the EDS1-dependent induction and repression of defense-related genes. EDS1 is capable of nuclear transport receptor-mediated shuttling between the cytoplasm and nucleus. By enhancing EDS1 export from inside nuclei (through attachment of an additional nuclear export sequence (NES)) or conditionally releasing EDS1 to the nucleus (by fusion to a glucocorticoid receptor (GR)) in transgenic Arabidopsis we establish that the EDS1 nuclear pool is essential for resistance to biotrophic and hemi-biotrophic pathogens and for transcriptional reprogramming. Evidence points to post-transcriptional processes regulating receptor-triggered accumulation of EDS1 in nuclei. Changes in nuclear EDS1 levels become equilibrated with the cytoplasmic EDS1 pool and cytoplasmic EDS1 is needed for complete resistance and restriction of host cell death at infection sites. We propose that coordinated nuclear and cytoplasmic activities of EDS1 enable the plant to mount an appropriately balanced immune response to pathogen attack.<div class="publication01HideAbstract"><a href="javascript:Publications.hideAbstract(120);">hide</a></div></div></div><div id="publication152" class="publication01"><div

  class="publication01Abstract" style="display:none;">Plant growth is influenced by genetic factors and environmental cues. Genotype-by-environment interactions are governed by complex genetic epistatic networks that are subject to natural selection. Here we describe a novel epistatic interaction modulating growth in response to temperature common to 2 Arabidopsis recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations (Ler x Kas-2 and Ler x Kond). At 14 degrees C, lines with specific allele combinations at interacting loci (incompatible interactions) have severe growth defects. These lines exhibit deregulated cell death programs and enhanced disease resistance. At 20 degrees C, growth defects are suppressed, but a positive trait of enhanced resistance is retained. Mapping of 1 interacting QTL to a cluster of RPP1-like TIR-NB-LRR genes on chromosome 3 is consistent with our finding that environmentally conditioned epistasis depends on activation of the salicylic acid (SA) stress signaling pathway. The nature of the epistatic interaction conforms to the Dobzhansky-Muller model of genetic incompatibility with incomplete penetrance for reproductive isolation. Variation in fitness of different incompatible lines reveals the presence of additional modifiers in the genetic background. We propose that certain interacting loci lead to an optimal balance between growth and resistance to pathogens by modulating SA signaling under specific environments. This could allow the accumulation of additional incompatibilities before reaching complete reproductive isolation.<div class="publication01HideAbstract"><a href="javascript:Publications.hideAbstract(152);">hide</a></div></div></div>
