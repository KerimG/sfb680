  class="publication01Abstract" style="display:none;">Whether evolution is erratic due to random historical details, or is repeatedly directed along similar paths by certain constraints, remains unclear. Epistasis (i.e. non-additive interaction between mutations that affect fitness) is a mechanism that can contribute to both scenarios. Epistasis can constrain the type and order of selected mutations, but it can also make adaptive trajectories contingent upon the first random substitution. This effect is particularly strong under sign epistasis, when the sign of the fitness effects of a mutation depends on its genetic background. In the current study, we examine how epistatic interactions between mutations determine alternative evolutionary pathways, using in vitro evolution of the antibiotic resistance enzyme TEM-1 beta-lactamase. First, we describe the diversity of adaptive pathways among replicate lines during evolution for resistance to a novel antibiotic (cefotaxime). Consistent with the prediction of epistatic constraints, most lines increased resistance by acquiring three mutations in a fixed order. However, a few lines deviated from this pattern. Next, to test whether negative interactions between alternative initial substitutions drive this divergence, alleles containing initial substitutions from the deviating lines were evolved under identical conditions. Indeed, these alternative initial substitutions consistently led to lower adaptive peaks, involving more and other substitutions than those observed in the common pathway. We found that a combination of decreased enzymatic activity and lower folding cooperativity underlies negative sign epistasis in the clash between key mutations in the common and deviating lines (Gly238Ser and Arg164Ser, respectively). Our results demonstrate that epistasis contributes to contingency in protein evolution by amplifying the selective consequences of random mutations.<div class="publication01HideAbstract"><a href="javascript:Publications.hideAbstract(1);">hide</a></div></div></div><div class="publication01"><div

For small populations demographic noise generates massive fluctuations in tesc.

  class="publication01Abstract" style="display:none;">The evolutionary effect of recombination depends crucially on the epistatic interactions between linked loci. A paradigmatic case where recombination is known to be strongly disadvantageous is a two-locus fitness landscape displaying reciprocal sign epistasis with two fitness peaks of unequal height. Although this type of model has been studied since the 1960s, a full analytic understanding of the stationary states of mutation-selection balance was not achieved so far. Focusing on the bistability arising due to the recombination, we consider here the deterministic, haploid two-locus model with reversible mutations, selection and recombination. We find analytic formulae for the critical recombination probability r ( c ) above which two stable stationary solutions appear which are localized on each of the two fitness peaks. We also derive the stationary genotype frequencies in various parameter regimes. In particular, when the recombination rate is close to r ( c ) and the fitness difference between the two peaks is small, we obtain a compact description in terms of a cubic polynomial which is analogous to the Landau theory of physical phase transitions.<div class="publication01HideAbstract"><a href="javascript:Publications.hideAbstract(9);">hide</a></div></div></div><div class="publication01"><div

  class="publication01Abstract" style="display:none;">Background: Recent experimental and theoretical studies have shown that small asexual populations evolving on complex fitness landscapes may achieve a higher fitness than large ones due to the increased heterogeneity of adaptive trajectories. Here we introduce a class of haploid three-locus fitness landscapes that allows to investigate this scenario in a precise and quantitative way. Results: Our main result derived analytically shows how the probability of choosing the path of largest initial fitness increase grows with the population size. This makes large populations more likely to get trapped at local fitness peaks and implies an advantage of small populations at intermediate time scales. The range of population sizes where this effect is operative coincides with the onset of clonal interference. Additional studies using ensembles of random fitness landscapes show that the results achieved for a particular choice of three-locus landscape parameters are robust and also persist as the number of loci increases. Conclusions: Our study indicates that an advantage for small populations is likely whenever the fitness landscape contains local maxima. The advantage appears at intermediate time scales, which are long enough for trapping at local fitness maxima to have occurred but too short for peak escape by the creation of multiple mutants<div class="publication01HideAbstract"><a href="javascript:Publications.hideAbstract(18);">hide</a></div></div></div><div class="publication01"><div

After introducing the required models and concepts of mathematical population genetics, we review different approaches to computing the speed of logarithmic fitness increase as a function of N, U and g(s). We present an exact solution of the infinite population size limit and provide an estimate of the population size beyond which it is valid. We then discuss approximate approaches to the finite population problem, distinguishing between the case of a single selection coefficient, g(s)=delta(s-s (b) ), and a continuous distribution of selection coefficients. Analytic estimates for the speed are compared to numerical simulations up to population sizes of order 10(300).<div class="publication01HideAbstract"><a href="javascript:Publications.hideAbstract(33);">hide</a></div></div></div><div class="publication01"><div

  class="publication01Abstract" style="display:none;">The nature of epistasis has important consequences for the evolutionary significance of sex and recombination. Recent efforts to find negative epistasis as a source of negative linkage disequilibrium and associated long-term advantage to sex have yielded little support. Sign epistasis, where the sign of the fitness effects of alleles varies across genetic backgrounds, is responsible for the ruggedness of the fitness landscape, with several unexplored implications for the evolution of sex. Here, we describe fitness landscapes for two sets of strains of the asexual fungus Aspergillus niger involving all combinations of five mutations. We find that similar to 30% of the single-mutation fitness effects are positive despite their negative effect in the wildtype strain and that several local fitness maxima and minima are present. We then compare adaptation of sexual and asexual populations on these empirical fitness landscapes by using simulations. The results show a general disadvantage of sex on these rugged landscapes, caused by the breakdown by recombination of genotypes on fitness peaks. Sex facilitates movement to the global peak only for some parameter values on one landscape, indicating its dependence on the landscape's topography. We discuss possible reasons for the discrepancy between our results and the reports of faster adaptation of sexual populations.<div class="publication01HideAbstract"><a href="javascript:Publications.hideAbstract(48);">hide</a></div></div></div><div class="publication01"><div

  class="publication01Abstract" style="display:none;">We numerically investigate the six-species predator-prey game in complex networks as well as in d-dimensional regular hypercubic lattices with d=1,2,...,6. The food-web topology of the six species contains two directed loops, each of which is composed of cyclically predating three species. As the mutation rate is lowered below the well-defined phase transition point, the Z(2) symmetry related with the interchange in the two loops is spontaneously broken, and it has been known that the system develops the defensive alliance in which three cyclically predating species defend each other against the invasion of other species. In the Watts-Strogatz small-world network structure characterized by the rewiring probability alpha, the phase diagram shows the reentrant behavior as alpha is varied, indicating a twofold role of the shortcuts. In d-dimensional regular hypercubic lattices, the system also exhibits the reentrant phase transition as d is increased.

We obtain analytic results for the robustness effect which become exact in the limit of infinite sequence length. Thereby, we are able to clarify a seeming contradiction between recent rigorous work and an earlier heuristic treatment based on mapping to a Schrodinger equation. We exploit the quantum mechanical analogy to calculate a correction term for finite sequence lengths and verify our analytic results by numerical studies. In addition, we investigate the occurrence of an error threshold for a general class of epistatic landscapes and show that diminishing epistasis is a necessary but not sufficient condition for error threshold behaviour.<div class="publication01HideAbstract"><a href="javascript:Publications.hideAbstract(57);">hide</a></div></div></div><div class="publication01"><div

  class="publication01Abstract" style="display:none;">Quantifying the dynamics of intrahost HIV-1 sequence evolution is one means of uncovering information about the interaction between HIV-1 and the host immune system. In the chronic phase of infection, common dynamics of sequence divergence and diversity have been reported. We developed an HIV-1 sequence evolution model that simulated the effects of mutation and fitness of sequence variants. The amount of evolution was described by the distance from the founder strain, and fitness was described by the number of offspring a parent sequence produces. Analysis of the model suggested that the previously observed saturation of divergence and decrease of diversity in later stages of infection can be explained by a decrease in the proportion of offspring that are mutants as the distance from the founder strain increases rather than due to an increase of viral fitness. The prediction of the model was examined by performing phylogenetic analysis to estimate the change in the rate of evolution during infection. In agreement with our modeling, in 13 out of 15 patients (followed for 3-12 years) we found that the rate of intrahost HIV-1 evolution was not constant but rather slowed down at a rate correlated with the rate of CD4+ T-cell decline. The correlation between the dynamics of the evolutionary rate and the rate of CD4+ T-cell decline, coupled with our HIV-1 sequence evolution model, explains previously conflicting observations of the relationships between the rate of HIV-1 quasispecies evolution and disease progression.<div class="publication01HideAbstract"><a href="javascript:Publications.hideAbstract(64);">hide</a></div></div></div><div class="publication01"><div

  class="publication01Abstract" style="display:none;">We consider the evolution of an asexually reproducing population in an uncorrelated random fitness landscape in the limit of infinite genome size, which implies that each mutation generates a new fitness value drawn from a probability distribution g(w). This is the finite population version of Kingman's house of cards model (Kingman 1978 J. Appl. Probab. 15 1). In contrast to Kingman's work, the focus here is on unbounded distributions g( w) which lead to an indefinite growth of the population fitness. The model is solved analytically in the limit of infinite population size N -> infinity and simulated numerically for infinite N. When the genome-wide mutation probability U is small, the long-time behavior of the model reduces to a point process of fixation events, which is referred to as a diluted record process (DRP). The DRP is similar to the standard record process except that a new record candidate (a number that exceeds all previous entries in the sequence) is accepted only with a certain probability that depends on the values of the current record and the candidate. We develop a systematic analytic approximation scheme for the DRP. At finite U the fitness frequency distribution of the population decomposes into a stationary part due to mutations and a traveling wave component due to selection, which is shown to imply a reduction of the mean fitness by a factor of 1 - U compared to the U -> 0 limit.<div class="publication01HideAbstract"><a href="javascript:Publications.hideAbstract(66);">hide</a></div></div></div><div class="publication01"><div

  class="publication01Abstract" style="display:none;">Clonal interference, the competition between lineages arising from different beneficial mutations in an asexually reproducing population, is an important factor determining the tempo and mode of microbial adaptation. The standard theory of this phenomenon neglects the occurrence of multiple mutations as well as the correlation between loss by genetic drift and clonal competition, which is questionable in large populations. Working within the Wright-Fisher model with multiplicative fitness (no epistasis), we determine the rate of adaptation asymptotically for very large population sizes and show that the standard theory fails in this regime. Our study also explains the success of the standard theory in predicting the rate of adaptation for moderately large populations. Furthermore, we show that the nature of the substitution process changes qualitatively when multiple mutations are allowed for, because several mutations can be fixed in a single fixation event. As a consequence, the index of dispersion for counts of the fixation process displays a minimum as a function of population size, whereas the origination process of fixed mutations becomes completely regular for very large populations. We find that the number of mutations fixed in a single event is geometrically distributed as in the neutral case. These conclusions are based on extensive simulations combined with analytic results for the limit of infinite population size.<div class="publication01HideAbstract"><a href="javascript:Publications.hideAbstract(85);">hide</a></div></div></div><div class="publication01"><div

  class="publication01Abstract" style="display:none;">We study the adaptation dynamics of an initially maladapted asexual population with genotypes represented by binary sequences of length L. The population evolves in a maximally rugged fitness landscape with a large number of local optima. We find that whether the evolutionary trajectory is deterministic or stochastic depends on the effective mutational distance d(eff) up to which the population can spread in genotype space. For d(eff) = L, the deterministic quasi-species theory operates while for d(eff) < 1, the evolution is completely stochastic. Between these two limiting cases, the dynamics are described by a local quasi-species theory below a crossover time T(x) while above T(x) the population gets trapped at a local fitness peak and manages to find a better peak via either stochastic tunneling or double mutations. In the stochastic regime d(eff) < 1, we identify two subregimes associated with clonal interference and uphill adaptive walks, respectively. We argue that our findings are relevant to the interpretation of evolution experiments with microbial populations.<div class="publication01HideAbstract"><a href="javascript:Publications.hideAbstract(87);">hide</a></div></div></div>
