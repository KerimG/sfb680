<h2><a href="project_area_c.html#c1">Project C1/C2</a>: Postdoc and PhD Positions in Statistical Physics/Quantitative Biology</h2>
<p>The University of Cologne offers a Postdoc and a PhD position 
in the research groups of Prof. Michael Lässig and Prof. Johannes
Berg within the framework of the Collaborative Research Centre 
SFB 680 "Molecular Basis of Evolutionary Innovations".</p>
<p>We are looking for highly motivated individuals who enjoy working in
an international team at the interface between statistical physics and
quantitative biology. Current research topics include gene expression, 
molecular evolution, and genomics. Projects involve concepts 
and methods from equilibrium and non-equilibrium physics and 
build on experimental collaborations. For more details, 
see www.thp.uni-koeln.de/~lassig/ and www.thp.uni-koeln.de/~berg.</p>
<p>Applicants should have a strong background in statistical physics and a 
genuine interest in biology. The appointment will start
in autumn 2013 or earlier. Applications including a CV, publication
list, research statement, and two letters of recommendation (one for the PhD position) mailed independently should be sent to SFB 680, c/o Christa Stitz, Institute for Theoretical Physics, University of Cologne, Zülpicher Straße 77,
D-50937 Köln, Germany. Applications can also be sent by email in a
single PDF-file to cstitz@uni-koeln.de. Pre-application enquiries are
welcome.</p>
<p>Cologne University is an equal opportunity employer, the positions are
open to EU and non-EU members.</p>
